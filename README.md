## Reflection
 
  - Develop in React.js
  - Please, consider that I'm not a designer. 
  - API call made by axios. I split the url to show that can turn into dinamics calls.
  - I'm not fan of make the logic in the client side.
  - The folders are splitten in components and container, it depends if has logic or not.
  - The filter function can be reusable if add inputs instead of clicking like I use.
  - If the app is rendered in Mobile or Desktop, shows 10 or 20 habitants
